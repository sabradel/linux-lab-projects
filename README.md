# Linux Lab Projects

Welcome to my Linux Lab Projects repository! This collection showcases my hands-on practice with Linux system administration, cybersecurity, and shell scripting through step-by-step labs and real-world scenarios.

## What You'll Find Here
- User and permission management
- Secure SSH configuration and hardening
- LAMP stack installation and setup
- Firewall configuration and monitoring with UFW
- System resource monitoring using tools like htop, glances, and dstat
- Basic security enhancements and automation scripts

Each project includes detailed instructions, commands used, and screenshots to demonstrate my progress and skills.
