# Linux Lab Projects - Repository Overview

Welcome! This repository contains step-by-step Linux system administration, cybersecurity, and SOC/blue team labs.

## 🔥 Featured Resume Projects (Start Here)

These projects best demonstrate hands-on Linux system administration and SOC/blue-team skills.  
Recruiters and reviewers are encouraged to start here:

- **Project 3: SSH Hardening**  
  Hardened SSH access by disabling root login, enforcing key-based authentication, and mitigating brute-force attacks.  
  👉 [View Project](project3-ssh-hardening/)

- **Project 4: Firewall Hardening**  
  Implemented UFW firewall rules to restrict network access and reduce attack surface on Linux servers.  
  👉 [View Project](project4-firewall-hardening/)

- **Project 9: Log Correlation & Detection**  
  Performed Linux log analysis and correlation to detect suspicious activity in a SOC-style investigation.  
  👉 [View Project](project9-log-correlation-detection/)

- **Project 13: Suricata IDS – Detection & Alert Tuning**
  Built a SOC lab using Suricata IDS, authored custom detection rules, validated alerts, and tuned noisy signatures.
  👉 [View Project](project13-suricata-ids-detection/)

- **Project 14: Wazuh SIEM – Authentication Attack Detection (Windows + Linux)**
  Built a SOC lab using Wazuh SIEM to detect and investigate authentication attacks across Windows and Linux endpoints. Validated alerts, reviewed evidence in Discover, and mapped detections to MITRE ATT&CK (T1110).
