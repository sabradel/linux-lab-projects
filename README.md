# Linux Lab Projects - Repository Overview

## 🎯 Career Target
**Junior Linux System Administrator / SOC Analyst (Blue Team) / IT Support (Linux-focused)**

**What I can do:** build Linux servers, secure SSH, centralize logs, detect attacks (Wazuh/Suricata), and document everything with proof screenshots.

Welcome! This repository contains step-by-step Linux system administration, cybersecurity, and SOC/blue team labs.

## 🔥 Featured Resume Projects (Start Here)

These projects best demonstrate hands-on SOC / Blue Team and detection skills. Recruiters are encouraged to start here:

---

## 🏗️ Project 19: Enterprise Infrastructure Security Lab (Multi-Server SOC Environment)

Designed and built a multi-server enterprise Linux environment including web, monitoring, logging, and backup servers. Simulated real SSH attacks from Kali Linux, centralized logs, investigated incidents, and implemented automated defense using Fail2ban.

## 🖥️ Project 24–26: Bare Metal SOC Log Server Pipeline (Physical Server + Logging + Retention)

Built a real Ubuntu Server on physical hardware (bare metal) and configured it as a SOC log server with static IP, SSH headless administration, centralized rsyslog forwarding, and log retention using logrotate.
