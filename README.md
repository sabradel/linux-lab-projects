These projects best demonstrate hands-on SOC / Blue Team and detection skills. Recruiters are encouraged to start here:

---

### 🛡️ Project 18: Windows Malware Detection (Defender + Wazuh SIEM)

Investigated real malware test detections (EICAR) on Windows using Microsoft Defender and correlated events in Wazuh SIEM. Demonstrated endpoint detection, log ingestion, SIEM visibility, and malware investigation workflow.

---

### 🔐 Project 14: Wazuh SIEM – Authentication Attack Detection (Windows + Linux)

Built a SOC lab using Wazuh SIEM to detect and investigate authentication attacks across Windows and Linux endpoints. Simulated SSH failures and Windows failed logons (Event ID 4625) and documented the investigation.
