- **Project 14: Wazuh SIEM – Authentication Attack Detection (Windows + Linux)**  
  Built a SOC lab using Wazuh SIEM to detect and investigate authentication attacks across Windows and Linux endpoints.  
  👉 [View Project](project14-wazuh-authentication-incident)

- **Project 13: Suricata IDS – Detection & Alert Tuning**  
  Built a SOC lab using Suricata IDS, authored custom detection rules, validated alerts, and tuned noisy signatures.

- **Project 12: Windows Active Directory Attack & Defense**  
  Simulated AD attacks, analyzed failed logons and account lockouts (Event IDs 4625, 4740), and documented detection evidence.
