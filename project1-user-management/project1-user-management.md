# Project 1: User Management on Rocky Linux

## Objective
Demonstrate basic user management on Rocky Linux by creating a new user, assigning a password, granting sudo privileges, and verifying elevated access.

## Tasks Performed
- Create a new user named `testuser`
- Set a password for `testuser`
- Add `testuser` to the `wheel` group for sudo access
- Switch to `testuser` and verify sudo access using `sudo whoami`

## Commands Used

# Create the user
sudo adduser testuser

# Set a password for the user
sudo passwd testuser

# Add the user to the 'wheel' group for sudo privileges
sudo usermod -aG wheel testuser

# Confirm user was created
getent passwd testuser
