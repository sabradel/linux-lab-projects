# Project 10: Advanced Log Correlation & Detection

## Objective
Show how a SOC analyst detects suspicious activity by correlating Linux authentication logs.

## Lab Setup
- Ubuntu Server: Log source
- Kali Linux: Attacker / testing machine
- Both machines are on the same internal network

## Tools Used
- Ubuntu Server 24.04
- Kali Linux
- journalctl
- grep
- awk
- wc

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Failed login detection
- Invalid user detection
- Privilege escalation tracking
- Basic log correlation (SOC Tier 1 skill)

## Lab Status
This project documents simulated attacks and log analysis performed in a controlled lab environment.
