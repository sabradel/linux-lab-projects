# project19 - Enterprise Linux Infrastructure, Security & Operations Lab

## Goal
Build a real enterprise-style lab with multiple Linux servers, centralized logging, monitoring, backups, and security hardening. Document everything step-by-step with proof (commands + screenshots).

## Lab Machines
- fedora-wrk01 (Admin Workstation)
- web01 (Ubuntu Web/App Server)
- backup01 (Ubuntu Backup Server)
- log01 (Ubuntu Log Server)
- monitor01 (Ubuntu Monitoring Server) - pending
- kali01 (Security Testing / Attack Simulation) - pending

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Multi-server Linux administration
- SSH and access control (keys, least privilege)
- Firewalling and service exposure control
- Centralized logging + auditing
- Monitoring and alerting
- Backup + restore testing
- Attack simulation and defensive validation
