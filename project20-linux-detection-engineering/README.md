# Project 20: Linux Detection Engineering & Threat Hunting (MITRE-Aligned SOC Lab)

## Objective
Design, test, and validate custom Linux security detections using a hypothesis-driven threat hunting methodology aligned with MITRE ATT&CK.

This project demonstrates detection engineering skills by identifying attacker behaviors, validating log sources, writing custom Wazuh rules, and tuning alerts to reduce false positives.
