# Project 24 – Bare Metal Ubuntu Log Server Setup (WiFi + Static IP + SSH Headless)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project documents how I converted an old laptop into a **real bare-metal Ubuntu Server** (NOT a VM) and configured it as a **headless SOC log server**.

The server runs on **WiFi** with a **static IP address** and is managed remotely via **SSH** from my MacBook and Linux workstation.

This project serves as the foundation for future SOC infrastructure such as:

- Centralized Linux log collection
- rsyslog forwarding
- Wazuh / Splunk / Graylog log ingestion
- Threat detection labs
- Incident response & forensic investigation environments

---

## ⭐ Why This Project Matters (What Makes It Strong)
Most students build servers only inside VirtualBox or VMware.
---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Linux Server installation on bare metal hardware
- WiFi troubleshooting on Ubuntu Server
- Static IP configuration using Netplan
- DNS and routing verification
- SSH headless remote administration
- Systemd service management
- SOC lab infrastructure preparation
- Professional GitHub documentation with screenshots evidence

In this project, I built a **real server on physical hardware**, configured networking manually, solved connectivity issues, and successfully deployed a stable headless setup.

Key achievements:

✅ Installed Ubuntu Server on bare metal laptop  
✅ Configured WiFi networking on Ubuntu Server  
✅ Assigned static IP address using Netplan  
✅ Verified routing + DNS resolution  
✅ Enabled SSH for remote headless access  
✅ Verified auto-connect and system uptime  
✅ Confirmed the system is NOT running inside a VM
