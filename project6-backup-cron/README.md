- Cron scheduling

## Key Steps
1. Write a backup script to archive important files or directories.
2. Schedule the script using cron for daily or periodic execution.
3. Test the backup script to ensure it works correctly.
4. Verify the contents of the generated backup files.

## Outcome
- Understand automation with cron jobs
