# Project 8: SOC Fundamentals Lab (Linux + Kali)

## Objective
Build a beginner-friendly SOC-style lab to practice detection,
logging, and basic incident investigation using Linux systems.

## Lab Scope
This project simulates a small environment where:
- Kali Linux acts as an attacker
- Ubuntu Server acts as a monitored target
- Activity is logged and analyzed instead of manually fixing issues

## Threat Model
The lab focuses on detecting:
- Network reconnaissance (ping, scanning)
- Unauthorized login attempts
- Suspicious process and network activity

## SOC Mindset Applied
- Observe before acting
- Logs over assumptions
- Detect, document, respond
- No “quick fixes” without evidence

## Technology Used
- Kali Linux
- Ubuntu Server
- Linux command-line tools
- VirtualBox internal networking

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this project, the system will:
- Log suspicious activity
- Allow basic investigation using logs
- Demonstrate SOC analyst thinking on Linux systems
