# Project 9: Log Correlation & Detection

## Objective
Demonstrate basic log correlation and detection techniques using Linux servers and Kali Linux for SOC-style analysis.

## Lab Overview
- Ubuntu Server acts as the log-generating system
- Kali Linux acts as the analyst/attacker/tester machine
- Simulate authentication events, failures, and suspicious activity
- Collect logs, correlate events, and detect anomalies

## Technology Used
- Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
- Kali Linux
- Linux command-line tools (`journalctl`, `grep`, `awk`, `wc`)
- Optional: Syslog configuration for log forwarding
